This application processes images using the following operations:
- erosion
- dilation
- threshold
- max_size
- min_size
- background_sub
- gamma_correction

The following input pattern is assumed: 
processed_image_name show_or_label operation_label_1 operation_parameter_1 ... operation_label_N operation_parameter_N

Example input can be found in the "Input" directory. In order to segment the dots in those images, values from "bestValues.txt" should be used.
